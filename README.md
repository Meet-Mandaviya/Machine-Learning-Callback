# Machine-Learning-Callback
If you built a model and you're training your model but you need to stop the training at desired accuracy.
Sometimes we get desired accuracy but still the model is being trained until all epochs are evaluated but then suddenly the accuracy get decreased so we don't get specific accuracy. Once you've reached your desired accuracy then it will instantly stop the training after that epoch so that we can get the accuracy we want
For example, Here I've taken 99% accuracy so after the model testing reach 99% then it'll stopÂ automatically.
